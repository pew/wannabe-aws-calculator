# Wannabe AWS Calculator
soon(TM)

# TODO
* [x] give those flask routes a version for future improvements without breaking stuff
* [ ] assemble json file on flask first-startup
* [ ] make region selectable
* [ ] show different instance types in a popover (modal) to select them (you know, like the aws calculator)
* [ ] get reserved instance pricing
* [ ] let users save pricing
